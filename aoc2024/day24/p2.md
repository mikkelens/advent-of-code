## Description

### Part Two

After inspecting the monitoring device more closely, you determine that the system you're simulating is trying to _add two binary numbers_.

Specifically, it is treating the bits on wires starting with `x` as one binary number, treating the bits on wires starting with `y` as a second binary number, and then attempting to add those two numbers together. The output of this operation is produced as a binary number on the wires starting with `z`. (In all three cases, wire `00` is the least significant bit, then `01`, then `02`, and so on.)

The initial values for the wires in your puzzle input represent _just one instance_ of a pair of numbers that sum to the wrong value. Ultimately, _any_ two binary numbers provided as input should be handled correctly. That is, for any combination of bits on wires starting with `x` and wires starting with `y`, the sum of the two numbers those bits represent should be produced as a binary number on the wires starting with `z`.

For example, if you have an addition system with four `x` wires, four `y` wires, and five `z` wires, you should be able to supply any four-bit number on the `x` wires, any four-bit number on the `y` numbers, and eventually find the sum of those two numbers as a five-bit number on the `z` wires. One of the many ways you could provide numbers to such a system would be to pass `11` on the `x` wires (`1011` in binary) and `13` on the `y` wires (`1101` in binary):

    x00: 1
    x01: 1
    x02: 0
    x03: 1
    y00: 1
    y01: 0
    y02: 1
    y03: 1
    

If the system were working correctly, then after all gates are finished processing, you should find `24` (`11+13`) on the `z` wires as the five-bit binary number `11000`:

    z00: 0
    z01: 0
    z02: 0
    z03: 1
    z04: 1
    

Unfortunately, your actual system needs to add numbers with many more bits and therefore has many more wires.

Based on <span title="ENHANCE">forensic analysis</span> of scuff marks and scratches on the device, you can tell that there are exactly _four_ pairs of gates whose output wires have been _swapped_. (A gate can only be in at most one such pair; no gate's output was swapped multiple times.)

For example, the system below is supposed to find the bitwise `AND` of the six-bit number on `x00` through `x05` and the six-bit number on `y00` through `y05` and then write the result as a six-bit number on `z00` through `z05`:

    x00: 0
    x01: 1
    x02: 0
    x03: 1
    x04: 0
    x05: 1
    y00: 0
    y01: 0
    y02: 1
    y03: 1
    y04: 0
    y05: 1
    
    x00 AND y00 -> z05
    x01 AND y01 -> z02
    x02 AND y02 -> z01
    x03 AND y03 -> z03
    x04 AND y04 -> z04
    x05 AND y05 -> z00
    

However, in this example, two pairs of gates have had their output wires swapped, causing the system to produce wrong answers. The first pair of gates with swapped outputs is `x00 AND y00 -> z05` and `x05 AND y05 -> z00`; the second pair of gates is `x01 AND y01 -> z02` and `x02 AND y02 -> z01`. Correcting these two swaps results in this system that works as intended for any set of initial values on wires that start with `x` or `y`:

    x00 AND y00 -> z00
    x01 AND y01 -> z01
    x02 AND y02 -> z02
    x03 AND y03 -> z03
    x04 AND y04 -> z04
    x05 AND y05 -> z05
    

In this example, two pairs of gates have outputs that are involved in a swap. By sorting their output wires' names and joining them with commas, the list of wires involved in swaps is _`z00,z01,z02,z05`_.

Of course, your actual system is much more complex than this, and the gates that need their outputs swapped could be _anywhere_, not just attached to a wire starting with `z`. If you were to determine that you need to swap output wires `aaa` with `eee`, `ooo` with `z99`, `bbb` with `ccc`, and `aoc` with `z24`, your answer would be _`aaa,aoc,bbb,ccc,eee,ooo,z24,z99`_.

Your system of gates and wires has _four_ pairs of gates which need their output wires swapped - _eight_ wires in total. Determine which four pairs of gates need their outputs swapped so that your system correctly performs addition; _what do you get if you sort the names of the eight wires involved in a swap and then join those names with commas?_
