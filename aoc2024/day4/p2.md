## Description

### Part Two

The Elf looks quizzically at you. Did you misunderstand the assignment?

Looking for the instructions, you flip over the word search to find that this isn't actually an _`XMAS`_ puzzle; it's an <span title="This part originally involved searching for something else, but this joke was too dumb to pass up."><code><em>X-MAS</em></code></span> puzzle in which you're supposed to find two `MAS` in the shape of an `X`. One way to achieve that is like this:

    M.S
    .A.
    M.S
    

Irrelevant characters have again been replaced with `.` in the above diagram. Within the `X`, each `MAS` can be written forwards or backwards.

Here's the same example from before, but this time all of the `X-MAS`es have been kept instead:

    .M.S......
    ..A..MSMS.
    .M.S.MAA..
    ..A.ASMSM.
    .M.S.M....
    ..........
    S.S.S.S.S.
    .A.A.A.A..
    M.M.M.M.M.
    ..........
    

In this example, an `X-MAS` appears _`9`_ times.

Flip the word search from the instructions back over to the word search side and try again. _How many times does an `X-MAS` appear?_
